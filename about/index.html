    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Bucket lists are important for a number of reasons. They provide a sense of purpose and direction, and help
      individuals set goals and work towards achieving them.</p>

    <p>Some of the reasons why bucket lists are important include: Helps you identify your passions: Having a bucket
      list allows you to think about what you truly enjoy and what you want to experience in life. It can help you
      identify your passions and interests, and give you a sense of direction and purpose. Provides motivation: Having a
      bucket list can provide motivation and inspiration to achieve your goals and dreams. It gives you something to
      work towards and can help you stay focused and motivated. Encourages you to step out of your comfort zone: Bucket
      lists often include activities or experiences that are outside of one's comfort zone. This can be challenging but
      ultimately rewarding, it helps to push you to try new things and to grow as a person.</p>
